What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it begins to be
tracked by git. Git stores information about the
files in the repository in a hidden folder called
.git.
You need to do it because git will not automatically
do it for you. Git allows you to choose which files
to commit by letting you "stage" them for the commit.
