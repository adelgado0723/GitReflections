What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it begins to be
tracked by git. Git stores information about the
files in the repository in a hidden folder called
.git.
You need to do it because git will not automatically
do it for you. Git allows you to choose which files
to commit by letting you "stage" them for the commit.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The repository is what gets tracked and shared with git.
The working directory is where you are making changes
to files, and the staging area is where you can choose
which changes to commit together.

This allows the user the control of being able to group
changes that are logically associated and commit them
together.
