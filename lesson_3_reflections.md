# Lesson 3 Reflections

## Reflection 1 - Remote Repositories 

**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?**

It is extremely useful to have your files in a remote repository when you
collaborate with others or even just when you want to be able to access your
files remotely from any device. However, if you only use one device and do not
work with other people on projects, you might not find the remote repository
beneficial.

## Reflection 2 - Manual vs. Automatic Pull

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

If Git automatically kept you up to date with the remote, the result could be
chaotic. Would the update cause you to loose work because the remote was
updated? Or what if the remote takes the project in a certain direction and you
want to try out something different? Automatic updates would make this
impossible.
